FUNCTIONALITY DEMO READ ME

So, since we were unable to finish our project in the time frame the version in this folder is the most accurate depiction of the
functionality that we inteded our Peer class to have. This version shows that the capability to send and recieve messages and requests
between peers by using placeholders instead of an actual data file.

TO RUN:
1) execute seeder.exe ---------> ./seeder.exe
2) execute leecher.exe --------> ./leecher.exe

The files leecherOutput.log and seederOutput.log show the output of running the above .exe's before they terminate due to a substring 
bounds error.
