Peer Tracker:

Overview:
- Keeps tracks of clients that connect to the server by storing the file names and port numbers of clients.
- Sends back to the client the necessary information it needs to download from the other peers.
- Stores file properties (Port number, filename) in lists so that it can be retreieved later and sent back to the client when download is called.

Files:
-tracker.c
-tracker.h
